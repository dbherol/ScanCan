# ScanCan

READMEs do more than explain how to use your project. They also explain why your project matters, and what your users can do with it.

How do I get started?
Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can use your README to answer other questions, like how you handle contributions, what the goals of the project are, and information about licenses and attribution. If you donâ€™t want to accept contributions, or your project is not yet ready for production, write this information down.

ScanCan is a command-line based, scalable framework designed to help students efficiently bridge and automate interactions between the Canvas web application and students' personal computers. The ScanCan framework provides a selection of modules that automatically organize and optomize academic resources so students can completely focus on the content of their courses.

Some example modules include:
Download_Files - Automatically downloads all available files for all classes. Organizes files based on semester/classes/file_structure_of_class... Syncs files to specified directory (if run multiple times). Student may chose to skip or replace duplicate files. 

Course_Information - Returns the first n-lines (10 default) of the syllabus for a specified course. May find information such as office hours, office locations, meeting times, instructor contact information, etc... 

Bookmarks - Pulls all external links referenced on a student's Canvas page and returns an organized bookmarks folder that may be uploaded to most browsers. Downloaded as a compressed zip file.

Priority_Checklist - Checklist that guides students on what assignments to work on, prepare for, and prioritize. Priority is based on due date and grade weight of assignment. May be downloaded as csv file or interactive pdf.
