A CONTRIBUTING file tells your audience how to participate in your project. For example, you might include information on:

    How to file a bug report (try using issue and pull request templates)
    How to suggest a new feature
    How to set up your environment and run tests

In addition to technical details, a CONTRIBUTING file is an opportunity to communicate your expectations for contributions, such as:

    The types of contributions you’re looking for
    Your roadmap or vision for the project
    How contributors should (or should not) get in touch with you

Using a warm, friendly tone and offering specific suggestions for contributions (such as writing documentation, or making a website) can go a long way in making newcomers feel welcomed and excited to participate.

For example, Active Admin starts its contributing guide with:

    First off, thank you for considering contributing to Active Admin. It’s people like you that make Active Admin such a great tool.

In the earliest stages of your project, your CONTRIBUTING file can be simple. You should always explain how to report bugs or file issues, and any technical requirements (like tests) to make a contribution.

Over time, you might add other frequently asked questions to your CONTRIBUTING file. Writing down this information means fewer people will ask you the same questions over and over again.
