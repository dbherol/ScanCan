# Contributions
## Introduction
Thank you for checking out ScanCan and looking into contributing to improve the lives of students! Whether you are a student who has a recently-discovered interest in computers, or a full-time professional who would like to provide some advice from experience, we invite you to joing our family and help improve this project. 

## Contribution guidelines
We are looking for all contributions from documentation to marketing to code and beyond. While we welcome anyone to contribute to our project, we ask that code is well-documented and all documents have consistient formatting.

## Vision
Our vision is to make lives easier for all students who use Canvas as an academic platform. We want to help de-clutter and optomize students' "academic paperwork" and help students get straight to learning the content of their courses. Although our project is mainly geared towards students who are familiar with open-sourced software, we would like to eventually provide support to all students through a desktop application, web application, and a browser extension. 

Thank you for exploring our project and supporting our dream.
